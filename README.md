# Duped

**The Chrome extension that helped users stop overpaying for fashion.**  
Duped let shoppers instantly find high-quality alternatives ("dupes") to brand-name fashion items — all from a single click.

---

## 🧠 The Problem  
Online shopping is full of hidden markups. Two nearly identical sweaters might differ in price by $60 — and users often don’t realize it. Searching manually for similar items across stores is slow and frustrating.

---

## 💡 What Duped Did  
Duped was built as a browser extension that:
- Detected the product a user was viewing
- Pulled lookalike options from other stores
- Displayed them instantly in a sleek popup

Users could shop smarter — without switching tabs.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Ran on 8+ popular fashion websites
- Used custom logic for similarity matching (text-based, w/ visual matching in progress)
- Achieved a 12.5%+ ad click-through rate in early user testing
- Waitlist signups from real Gen Z shoppers

---

## 🚧 Current Status: Paused
Due to API costs, Duped is currently inactive.  
But it remains a complete, working proof of concept built solo — from code to rollout to marketing.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Chrome Extension APIs
- Early experimentation with ad integration and recommendation logic
